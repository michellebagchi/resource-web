                    <li>Using a slotted spoon, gently lower the cold </br> eggs into the water one at a time.</li>
                    <li>Cook for exactly 6½ minutes, adjusting the heat <br>as necessary to maintain a gentle boil.</li>
                    <li>Meanwhile, fill a bowl with cold water and some ice <br>cubes. When the eggs are done cooking, transfer them </br>to the water and chill until just slightly warm, about 2 minutes.</li>
                    <li>If you don’t egg cups but would like to serve <br>the soft-boiled eggs this way, you can also use shot glasses. Alternatively, the eggs can be peeled and sliced in half.</li>
