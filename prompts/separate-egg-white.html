                    <li>Set out two bowls.</li>
                    <li>Crack the egg:
                        Gently crack the egg on a flat <br>surface or on the rim of a bowl, as close to </br>the middle of the egg as possible. If you crack <br> it on the rim of a bowl it might be easier to </br>get the egg to crack right in the middle, but <br>you may be more likely to get pieces of</br> eggshell in the egg whites..</li>
                    <li>Gently pry the egg halves apart:
                        Working over <br> a small bowl, use your thumbs to gently pry </br> the egg halves apart. Let the yolk settle in <br> the lower half of the egg shell while </br>the egg whites run off the sides of the <br>egg into the bowl.</li>
                    <li>Gently transfer the egg yolk back and forth<br> between the egg shell halves:
                        Let as much </br>egg white as you can drip into the bowl below. <br>Be careful so as not to break the egg yolk. </br>Place the egg yolk in a separate bowl.</li>
